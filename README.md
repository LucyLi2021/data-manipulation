Data Manipulation in JD.com

Accomplishing some daily data wrangling needs using python (pandas, numpy), R (tidyverse, data.table), SQL (processed on hive). Sometimes the amount of data will be huge and excel cannot open it and it will take me over an hour to run just one SQL file.

In addition, EasyBI_sql_code.sql is processed in EasyBI, a platform built by JD.com and familiar with PowerBI.
